# One Month Rails

This is a Pinterest-inspired tutorial using Ruby Rails and created by Mattan Griffel of [*One Month Rails*](http://onemonthrails.com).

I promise to follow better instructions, at least during the first run-through and not get overly excited and rush through areas that I think I already know. Patience, fool.
